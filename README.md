# GitOps

These actions can be used together in a job to make changes to a source repo and create a pull request to trigger a update in a downstream dependency.

 - [gitops-gh-pr](./gitops-gh-pr/)
 - [gitops-update-yaml](./gitops-update-yaml/)
 - [gitops-semver-increment-yaml](./gitops-semver-increment-yaml/)

# oauth2-token

An action for fetching an access token using the client credentials flow. 
The `accessToken` output is [masked](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#masking-a-value-in-log) from the build logs.

```yaml
jobs:
  demo:
    steps:
    - name: Fetch Token
      uses: liatrio/github-actions/oauth2-token@master
      id: token
      with:
        clientId: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_ID }}
        clientSecret: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_SECRET }}
        scopes: "custom_scope" # optional
        tokenUrl: https://idp.example.com/oauth2/token
    - name: API Request
      run: |
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ steps.token.outputs.accessToken }}" https://api.example.com/protected
```

# conventional-release

The actions wraps [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), which can be used to automatically 
bump the version (based on [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)), generate changelogs, and create GitHub releases.

The repository should include a `semantic-release` [config file](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration)
as there's likely a need to change the defaults for non-JavaScript projects. 

```yaml
jobs:
  release:
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Release
        uses: liatrio/github-actions/conventional-release@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

# conventional-pr-title

A GitHub Action for enforcing that pull request titles use [conventional commit prefixes](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
By default, the action uses the conventional commit preset list (minus `chore:`), but that can be overwritten by passing the `prefixes` input.

For pull requests with a single commit, the action will check that the commit uses an allowed prefix. This is because GitHub
uses the commit message instead of the pull request title as the default text in the squash merge dialog when the branch only has a single commit.
Note that this action should be used with repositories that only permit squash merge; this will help enforce that only conventional commit prefixes land in the target branch. 

```yaml
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: liatrio/github-actions/conventional-pr-title@master
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

# apprentice-action 

This [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) is used to verify the functionality of the application created as part of Liatrio's apprenticeship interview exercise and should be included as a step in the GitHub Workflow created for the exercise. It will execute some endpoint tests (HTTP calls) against your application and ensure that your application has the expected behavior.

This action defaults to testing port 80.

### How to use
1. Include the action in your GitHub Workflow
2. Run the workflow and verify that the tests pass

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: run tests
      uses: liatrio/github-actions/apprentice-action@master
```
